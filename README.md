## Project Purpose

```
### As part of my University of Denver Coding Bootcamp, we have been assigned the task of refactoring html & CSS code to meet the Acceptance Criteria and User Story below.
```

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## HTML Approach

```
1. Comment on the HTML elements to clearly define the purpose and nature of the element.
2. Convert atomic elements to semantic elements to meet accessibility standards.
3. Look at the logical structure of the elements and place elements in a logical way to represent nature and functionality in the website.
4. Provide accessible alt attributes for all img tags.
5. Place the heading elements in sequential order.
6. Replace the title element.
7. Ensure all website functionality such as links are working properly.
8. Make changes to the CSS file to reflect the above changes and optimize CSS for accessibility standards.
```

## CSS Approach

```
1. Changed CSS elements to correspond to elements in revised HTML file.
2. Consolidated CSS to remove redundant styling attributes.
```

## Deployment

```
1. All changes above were commited with messages to this repository.
2. Project website is available at:
